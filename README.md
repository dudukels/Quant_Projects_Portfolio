# Quant_Projects_Portfolio
Quant-related projects that apply Statistical & ML models, data analytics, Finance, Risk, etc.

Welcome to my Quant Projects Portfolio!

My goal is to showcase Quant-related projects that I have worked on to add value to my qualifications as I apply for Quant internships.
As of 4/12/2024, I am currently attending Claremont Graduate University in CA for my MS Financial Engineering. I am expected to graduate in June 2026.

Presently, I am also serving a Southern Californian power utility as a full-time Electrical Engineer. I am in the process of career transitioning to a Quantitative/Analytics role in Finance, Asset Management, and Energy Markets.
